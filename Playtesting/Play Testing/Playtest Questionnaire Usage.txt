Have the play tester play the game first

Then have them either fill in or answer the first three questions on the form.
These questions are intentionally vague to give the tester opportunity to provide whatever feedback they have.
This part is less important than the second part,

The second set of questions are for you to fill out, try to do them while watching the play tester actually playing the game.
These questions are the most important and rely on observing the behavior of the play tester mid-game and interpreting whats was good or bad about their experience and what we can improve or enhance.

When these are filled out make sure to put your own name on the document so we know who carried it out.
